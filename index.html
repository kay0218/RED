       <p>Labelled amongst fans as being her least sonically cohesive album, RED touches on the tumultous emotions of being in a relatioship. The infatuation, subsequent adventures, initmacy, heartbreak, and aftermath come together to create an album filled with songs from different genres for every situation. With 7 singles released, Swift achieved her first ever Billboard Hot 100 #1 resultant of the single <i>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"</i> although this wasn't the song that became a fan favourite.  </p>

    <p>Swift is known for her track 5's, and this album, quite possibly has the most loved track 5 of her entire discography. <strong>All Too Well.</strong> Written about a short but intense relationship, All Too Well encapsulates the story into 5 minutes and 29 seconds. The emotions Swift put into the song, studio and live bought to life the memories and moments for the fans. Some may say that the bridge of this song is the most heartbreaking of all. RED (Taylor's Version) includes a 10 minute version of the song, which has the original lyrics written during the rehearsal that created the song. With the added verse, bridge, and chorus, we get an even detailed insight into the relationship behind the song. Once again, Swift wows the crowd with her vivid songwriting that leans towards storytelling. </p>
