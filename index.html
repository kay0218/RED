       <p class="light-mode" >Labelled amongst fans as being her least sonically cohesive album, RED touches on the tumultous emotions of being in a relatioship. The infatuation, subsequent adventures, initmacy, heartbreak, and aftermath come together to create an album filled with songs from different genres for every situation. With 7 singles released, Swift achieved her first ever Billboard Hot 100 #1 resultant of the single <i>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,"</i> although this wasn't the song that became a fan favourite.  </p>

       <h2><span class="bebas dark-mode">"these songs that no one's ever heard of before."</span></h2>
       <p class="dark-mode"> Through the process of re-recording her albums, Taylor told Jimmy Fallon about how she got to rediscover the songs that were meant to be on the album, but were excluded for other reasons. Owning her re-releases means that Taylor can control what songs are put onto the album even if that means giving the album a whopping 30 songs. </p>

    <h2><span class="bebas light-mode">"so casually cruel in the name of being honest"</span></h2>
    <p class="light-mode">Swift is known for her track 5's, and this album, quite possibly has the most loved track 5 of her entire discography. <strong>All Too Well.</strong> Written about a short but intense relationship, All Too Well encapsulates the story into 5 minutes and 29 seconds. The emotions Swift put into the song, studio and live bought to life the memories and moments for the fans. Some may say that the bridge of this song is the most heartbreaking of all. RED (Taylor's Version) includes a 10 minute version of the song, which has the original lyrics written during the rehearsal that created the song. With the added verse, bridge, and chorus, we get an even detailed insight into the relationship behind the song. Once again, Swift wows the crowd with her vivid songwriting that leans towards storytelling. </p>

    <h2><span class="bebas dark-mode">"A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you"</span></h2>
    <p class="dark-mode"> After 10 years of begging, Taylor Swift released the 10 minute version of <strong>All Too Well.</strong> Written about a short but intense relationship, the emotions Swift put into the song, studio and live bought to life the memories and moments for the fans. Known for it's tumultous heartbreak, <strong>ATWTMVTVFTV</strong> once again takes back the crown for being the fan favourite and Taylor Swift wows the crowd, AGAIN, with the lyrics once thought lost to time. But now, instead of being treated as a heartbreaker, tearjerker, the track's hidden lyrics have turned it into an anthem worthy to be chanted back to Swift once tour returns. </p>
