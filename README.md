# RED
My attempt at a proper first website. Done during the November/December 2021 batch of IBM's Code The Future.

Some elements have been added since - such as the dark and light mode media query. Changing system's color mode will change which version of the website you see. 

Currently no plans to change or add anything more. It will be left as is.
