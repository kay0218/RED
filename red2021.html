       <p> Through the process of re-recording her albums, Taylor told Jimmy Fallon about how she got to rediscover the songs that were meant to be on the album, but were excluded for other reasons. Owning her re-releases means that Taylor can control what songs are put onto the album even if that means giving the album a whopping 30 songs. </p>

    <p> After 10 years of begging, Taylor Swift released the 10 minute version of <strong>All Too Well.</strong> Written about a short but intense relationship, the emotions Swift put into the song, studio and live bought to life the memories and moments for the fans. Known for it's tumultous heartbreak, <strong>ATWTMVTVFTV</strong> once again takes back the crown for being the fan favourite and Taylor Swift wows the crowd, AGAIN, with the lyrics once thought lost to time. But now, instead of being treated as a heartbreaker, tearjerker, the track's hidden lyrics have turned it into an anthem worthy to be chanted back to Swift once tour returns. </p>

    <p>After the sale of her masters during 2020, Swift decided to rerecord her first 6 albums. The 2nd rerecord released is RED. Included in this is the 10 minute version <i>All Too Well</i>, the 2016 song <i>Better Man</i> that was given to Little Big Town, and the 2018 song <i>Babe</i> given to Sugarland - both of which were orginally written for RED, as well as a duet with Phoebe Bridger's on <i>Nothing New</i> that gave all fans a mental breakdown.</p>
